  summary: Jupyter notebooks as Markdown documents, Julia, Python or R scripts
  description: |
    Represent Jupyter notebooks as Markdown documents or Julia, Python or R scripts. Convert any
    script or Markdown document to a Jupyter notebook. Round trip conversion is robust and well tested.

    Use these simpler representations to do version control and collaborate on Jupyter notebooks.
    And refactor your notebooks encoded as scripts in your favorite IDE.

    Jupytext is available directly in Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab, and also on the command line.
